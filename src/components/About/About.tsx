      <p>
        I am Sai Teja a passionate and creative developer based in Hyderabad,
        Telangana, India. As I studied <strong>computer science</strong>, I
        discovered I enjoy programming. It sparked my interest and made me
        curious about all the cool things you can do with tech. Out of many
        streams in programming <strong>web development</strong> appealed to me
        the most. It allows me paint my idea on the canvas and provide it for
        the world to see. My core stack is <strong>React</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Node.js</strong>, and <strong>MongoDB</strong>. I am familliar
        with TypeScript, Next.js, Python. I'm always eager to embrace new
        technologies and expand my skill set. I'm looking forward to working
        with you.

        While I'm not coding, I enjoy watching movies and shows, drawing
        pictures, playing video games and travelling.
